Hi, I'm Jasper and have 3 years of experience as Front End Developer. I'm the one who you are looking for. Because I have developed two E-Commerce site in single handedly. I have done HTML, CSS, Javascript with jQuery too. That's my front end work. But I have also worked extensively in back end work using Codeigniter PHP Framework with MySQL then API for payment gateway. I can code anything to get visual look what client expect and impress them with CSS3 animation. I can also work in SVG and canvas kind of animation to get high scale visual look. What else you expect more, oh, yeah, I can understand what you want now! ReactJS. Yes, I know ReactJS. That is heart of front end development now. How can I miss my heart. More than words my work will speak louder. Check my portfolio site
